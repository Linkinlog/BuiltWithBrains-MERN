							<strong>How it all works</strong>
						</h1>
						<h2 className='text-decoration-underline'>Check Ins</h2> <div className='text-center mb-5'>These will be done weekly or biweekly, whichever you prefer, through email and will include: 1) morning fasted weight (wake up, use the bathroom, and step on the scale) 2) Include any pertinent information such as hunger levels, energy levels, digestion problems, stress, sleep. I would also like you to include how well you followed the plan from 0% to 100%, no judgement just be honest, it is the best way for me to be able to accurately adjust things. 3) Progress pictures with front, side, and back either relaxed or posing however you prefer. à These are completely OPTIONAL however often times clients get caught up in the number on the scale and pictures help them see the changes they are making over time. Even if you don’t want to send them to me I still highly recommend taking them for yourself. **I will not track you down for your check ins, these are completely up to you whether you send them or not**</div> <h2 className='text-decoration-underline'> Meal Plan </h2>
						<div className='text-center mb-5'>The calories that you were eating were extremely low compared to what your BMR is. I increased your calories a bit to see if this kick starts your metabolism a bit. I also noticed you were eating very little protein so I increased your protein intake quite a bit. Since your calories are quite higher than you are used to you might see a jump in the scale but I want to see how your body responds first. The meal plan is structured to give you some variety for your meals. We will adjust the calories as needed if we are seeing too big of a jump or too little of a jump. I know you are in the process of finding a gym but when you do start lifting, on days that you take off from the gym I want you to cut your carbs for each meal in half. Each meal should have 1 cups of veggies with it (doesn’t matter what kind). Try to avoid any creamy dressings or heavy oils unless specified in the plan. I usually just use PAM nonstick spray when I cook anything. Seasonings are definitely okay to add as long as they are low in sugar. I have about a million different seasonings in my cabinets. Try to keep any condiments low in calories or all natural. A sauce that I really love is J Hughes Sugar Free sauces, a little pricey but definitely worth it if you like BBQ sauce. Mustard and hot sauce are other good options. </div><h2 className='text-decoration-underline'>Free Meal</h2><div className='text-center'>I strongly encourage you to get creative with your meal plan so things don’t get boring. I like to make turkey burger patties out of the ground turkey and put them with an English muffin for a mini burger. I also make a chicken, veggie, rice stir fry with fat free Italian dressing. It makes turning this into a lifestyle change much easier and more enjoyable! I don’t believe that anyone should strict diet without some variability. Therefore, one meal per week (or every other week) I want you to have a free meal. This can be anything you want but keep in mind it is NOT a full cheat day (and it should not be a binge meal). Although this may seem strict to only have one cheat meal, in reality, cheat days can ruin your entire week of dieting very quickly. If you have been strict dieting for a month, then yes, a cheat day may be appropriate but doing this every week can easily derail any progress which is why we keep it to one meal per week. I typically plan my cheat meal to be in late afternoon or dinner because if I cheat in the morning then my whole day turns into bad eating. The only thing I would recommend with timing of the cheat meal is try not to have it the night before you check in with me because your weight will be inflated from holding extra water. </div><h2 className="text-decoration-underline">WATER: </h2><div className="text-center">try to get in close to gallon a day. If you are like me and absolutely despise the taste of plain water you can use Mio squirts or crystal light flavor packs (low cal ones) just don’t go crazy with them. </div><h2 className="text-decoration-underline">SUPPLEMENTS:</h2> <div className="text-center">supplements are there ONLY to supplement your diet which is why I try not to over emphasize them (especially protein powder and things like BCAAs/EAAs). I always recommend that my clients take a Multi vitamin, probiotic, and a fish oil. These three supplements are KEY for completing a healthy diet and to maximize nutrient absorption/minimize inflammation. If there are other supplements you are interested in trying feel free to ask me about it and I can give you my best input.</div> <h2 className="text-decoration-underline">Workouts</h2> <div className="text-center">Something that I found really helpful was tracking my lifts. Each week I would write down how many reps and at what weight I did each exercise that way when I do that lift the following week I know what reps I have to beat or what weight I have to increase to. This can be a little bit time consuming but if you don’t have a partner to lift with it can really help you 1. Push yourself each week and 2. Track your progress. I want you to make sure you are pushing yourself with each lift but also focusing on keeping proper form. If you are unsure how to perform a specific exercise, youtube is a great tool and I can also send you some videos of me doing the exercise. </div> <h2 className="text-decoration-underline">Cardio</h2> <div className="text-center">When you get access to a gym we will change this around a bit but for now I really want you to try to hit 10,000 steps a day. Especially with you have a sedentary job, our biggest goal is just going to be to get you moving around. Hitting those steps each day is a really good start to becoming more active</div> <h2 className="text-decoration-underline">Final Thoughts</h2><div className="text-center"> <span className="text-decoration-underline">As I am sure you know, progress is always a marathon not a sprint. It is a slow process and takes a lot of trial and error at first.</span> The first few weeks might take some adjusting with dieting but we will work the kinks out together! You have 24/7 access to me whenever you have questions, I generally always have my phone on me and will get back to you either right away or at least sometime during that day. Phone number is (732)-551-1949. I am extremely excited to start working together and moving you towards your goals!</div>
